# Grapefruit Landing Page

Grapefruit is my all time favorite fruit. So why not use it to create a landing page to practice as it were a product?
A landing page made with a mobile-first approach, pure css and no frameworks.

### Why?
In order to practice I made a landing page without any framework.
What I'm practicing with this:

- CSS
- HTML
- Mobile first approach
- Responsive design
- SEO
- BEM Naming convention
